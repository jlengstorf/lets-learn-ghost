  Let’s Learn Ghost on the Jamstack!

  This app was built live on <em>Learn With Jason</em> and it was super fun and I’m sad you weren’t there.

Where does the content for our Jamstack sites live? In this episode, [Dave Darnes](https://twitter.com/DavidDarnes) teaches us how Ghost makes content management on the Jamstack so easy it‘s spooky!

**NOTE:** the code for the 11ty and Gatsby sites was manually deployed using the [drag-and-drop option](https://app.netlify.com/drop?utm_source=learnwithjason&utm_medium=lets-learn-ghost-jl&utm_campaign=devex) in Netlify. This repo [redirects](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/?utm_source=learnwithjason&utm_medium=lets-learn-ghost-jl&utm_campaign=devex) to those manual deploys.
